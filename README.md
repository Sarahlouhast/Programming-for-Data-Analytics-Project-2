http://localhost:8888/tree.

Project Jupyterâ€™s tools are available for installation via the Python Package Index, the leading repository of software created for the Python programming language.
It is an open source web application used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.
The Jupyter Notebook is a useful tool to learn Python language and also enables sharing of data and images in a very accessible way.
